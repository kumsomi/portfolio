            <h2>Taking baby steps to improve my daily habits</h2>
            <small>September, 2021</small>
            <p class="blog-para">
              No wonder, if I could take these baby steps of improving myself without the recommendation of a book named “Atomic Habit” by James Clear.
            Before Covid-19 came and lockdown happened, I was known as the most hyperactive human among all the peers, classmate, neighbors and almost everywhere I go. I was a social human, who would just start a conversation randomly and be in the same flow for minutes and hours. But lockdown impacted my life in a different way. I was in final year, everyone around me was either getting placed, or preparing for higher studies.

            <h2>My takeaway from Neog level zero</h2>
            <small>September, 2021</small>
            <p class="blog-para">This is my story of NeogCamp level zero. First of all I started a bit late. My submission was due on 30th September and I started with level zero on 15th September. Which means I only had one day to finish one-mark. Initially I was taking it slow, in order to understand the concepts. But once, I was clear with the basics, I started enjoying it. More than just finishing those marks, I even tried attempting the bonus exercises for almost every mark.
